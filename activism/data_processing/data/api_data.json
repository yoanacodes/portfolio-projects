The briefcase has four circular rubber pads on each side. A sticker near the handle of the briefcase has a barcode and black text that reads “PROPERTY OF LEE COUNTY ELECTIONS 00000104.” A sticker on top of the briefcase reads “CES VOTOMATIC.” Inside the briefcase there are four metal legs (2013.181.1b-e). The metal legs consist of two rods that are connected through elastic string on their inside. The legs fit into four holes in the bottom of the briefcase. Adhered to the inside of the briefcase top is a large informational graphic with black type titled “Voting Instructions.” A power cord attaches to a fluorescent light bulb on the top of the briefcases inside. Two plastic walls fold out of the briefcase and attach to the sides of the briefcase to shield the voting surface. On the inside of the briefcase's bottom is a surface for the voting ballot. At the center of the surface is a clear plastic cover with several small holes that goes over the ballot and is used in punching holes in the ballot. Directly above this plastic cover is a slot with instructions that read, “INSERT CARD HERE” with an arrow pointing down. Also directly above the plastic cover are the instructions “DO NOT FOLD BALLOT PRIOR TO INSERTING!!!” To the left of the plastic cover are instructions in black type. To the right of the plastic cover is red type. In the top right corner of the voting surface is a metal chain connected to a metal point meant to be held by the voter. In the bottom right corner of the voting surface is a black and grey sticker that reads “CES VOTOMATIC.” Found inside the case are two small metal pieces and a small rubber pad (2013.181.1f-g)."}],"creditLine":[{"label":"Credit Line","content":"Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture"}],"name":[{"label":"Manufactured by","content":"Computer Election Systems, Inc., American, founded 1969"}],"topic":[{"label":"Topic","content":"African American"},{"label":"Topic","content":"Politics"},{"label":"Topic","content":"Suffrage"},{"label":"Topic","content":"Technology"},{"label":"Topic","content":"U.S. History, 1969-2001"}],"place":[{"label":"Place used","content":"Lee County, Florida, United States, North and Central America"}],"physicalDescription":[{"label":"Medium","content":"aluminum, metal, plastic, paper, glass, rubber, and elastic"},{"label":"Dimensions","content":"briefcase: 4 x 22 x 21 1/2 in.
