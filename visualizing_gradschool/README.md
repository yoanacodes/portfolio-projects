#### About:
This project is mainly about experimenting with DynamoDb as a database and getting to know AWS. It was part of a class on Data Structures I took in the MS Data Visualization program at Parsons School of Design. 

This project visualizes four weeks of my life in grad school â€“ measuring sleep, energy levels and steps taken during each Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday (the days I had the most classes). It was interesting to reflect on my life in a visual form and observe the patterns.
